\paragraph{Abstract}
\emph{Program verification} has recently become a popular means to guarantee the correctness and security of critical systems.
%
As the complexity of those systems increased, engineers started looking into \emph{Program Synthesis} to automate the process of implementing programs that are correct by construction.
%
We propose extending one such program synthesis framework, namely \emph{Syntax-Guided Synthesis (SyGuS)}, to include a new functionality of generating optimized programs according to user-provided weights.
%
The outcomes of this work enables engineers to have access to \emph{optimal}, \emph{correct}, and \emph{secure} programs that satisfy their different constraints, i.e., hardware constraints, performance constraints, etc.
