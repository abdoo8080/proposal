\section{Broader impact}
\label{sec:impact}
Program Synthesis has a wide variety of applications from synthesizing new hardware circuits, to generating SQL queries, to generating secure protocols.
%
SyGuS utilizes the rich framework for program verification and its mature tools to synthesize programs with desired correctness and security guarantees.
%
However, we often care about other, sometimes competing, ``soft" constraints.
%

Take hardware synthesis for example, a hardware architect spends much of their time minimizing cost and power consumption of their hardware while maximizing the performance (i.e., minimizing latency).
%
We can encode those 3 constraints as weights on the grammar rules representing individual components of the hardware.
%
We can then use SyGuS solvers to help us compare different designs that minimize each constraint independently or several combinations of those constraints.
%

Another example is synthesis of SQL queries where the main priority is to optimize their performance.
%
SQL queries are compiled to execution plans by Database managment systems.
%
Those execution plans consist of small steps like: table scan, filter, hashjoin, sort, etc.
%
Some of those steps, e.g., scan, are more expensive than others.
%
Synthesizing a plan can be formulated as a SyGuS problem, where the optimization goal is to reduce the number of expensive steps.
%

There are more example use cases not included for space constraints. We believe that Program Synthesis with weights can be beneficial to any systems that requires correctness with known constraints.
