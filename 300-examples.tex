\section{Motivating example: matrix multiplication}
\label{sec:example}

Assume that we want to write a program that multiplies two matrices efficiently. 
%
Not only do we care about its functional correctness, but also about its running time.
%
A $2 \times 2$ instance of the problem can be described as: given two matrices $A = (a_{ij})$ and $B = (b_{ij})$, find a program that efficiently computes the product, which is specified as
%
\begin{equation}
    AB =
\begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} * b_{11} + a_{12} * b_{21} &
a_{11} * b_{12} + a_{12} * b_{22} \\
a_{21} * b_{11} + a_{22} * b_{21} &
a_{21} * b_{12} + a_{22} * b_{22} \\
\end{pmatrix}
\label{eqn:matrix-mul}
\end{equation}
% %
% This definition requires 8 multiplication operations and 4 additions.
% %
% Multiplication operations are known to be more expensive than addition.
% %
% A more efficient formulation requiring only 7 multiplications (at the expense of more additions) was discovered by Strassen:
% %
%
% \begin{tabular}{llll}
%     $ m_{1} = (a_{11} + a_{22}) * (b_{11} + b_{22}) $ &
%     $ m_{2} = (a_{21} + a_{22}) * b_{11} $ &
%     $ m_{3} = a_{11} * (b_{12} - b_{22}) $ \\
%     $ m_{4} = a_{22} * (b_{21} - b_{11}) $ &
%     $ m_{5} = (a_{11} + a_{12}) * b_{22} $ &
%     $ m_{6} = (a_{21} - a_{11}) * (b_{11} + b_{12}) $ \\
%     & $ m_{7} = (a_{12} - a{22}) * (b_{21} + b_{22}) $
% \end{tabular}
%
% \[ AB =
% \begin{pmatrix}
%     m_1 + m_4 - m_5 + m_7 &
%     m_3 + m_5 \\
%     m_2 + m_4 &
%     m_1 - m_2 + m_3 + m_6 \\
% \end{pmatrix} \]
Using a SyGuS solver to synthesize a solution, we can use the following simple grammar:
%
\[
S ::=
\begin{pmatrix} I & I \\
I & I
\end{pmatrix}, \quad
I ::= V \ | \ I + I \ | \ I - I \ | \ I * I, \quad
V ::= a_{ij} \ | \ b_{ij},
\]
%
where $S$ is the start symbol.
%
Current SyGuS solvers return a naive implementation that performs the exact operation in the formulation using 8 multiplications and 4 additions.
%
Multiplication, however, is known to be more computationally expensive than addition.
%
So, we would prefer implementations that reduce the number of multiplications like Strassen's algorithm, which performs only 7 multiplications, over the naive version~\cite{strassen:1969}.
