\section{Proposal}
\label{sec:proposal}
%
In this research project, our goal is two fold:
%
first to design and implement new algorithms that generate functions satisfying some optimization constraints,
%
and second to restrict the generation of such functions based on a hint or a guide.
%
More formally, we want to enumerate terms in the SyGuS grammar that generate functions with minimal weight.
%
To reach such goals we are implementing two different strategies: we begin with terms having minimum weight and check them against the unweighted solution.
%
pro: guarantees minimality of weight
con: slow

The second strategy begin with the unweighted solution and try to minimize
pro: fast. improves with time
con: lose minimality guarantee
